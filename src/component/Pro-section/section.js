            <h2>Soft Drinks</h2>
            <p>
              Soft drinks make a growing contribution to the diet of children
              and adolescents. The quantity of soft drinks consumed, especially
              carbonated soft drinks, increases with age and accounts for the
              largest single food contribution to nonmilk extrinsic sugar intake
              among young people in the UK (Burniat et al., 2002). One
              prospective study has reported a positive association between
              consumption of sugar-sweetened drinks and obesity in 548 children
              age 11 or 12 years over 19 months' follow-up (Ludwig et al.,
              2001). It found that each sugared soft drink the children consumed
              each day inched their BMI up by 0.18 points. If they increased
              their daily soft drink intake, each extra soda made them 60% more
              likely to become obese, regardless of how many sodas they were
              drinking before.
